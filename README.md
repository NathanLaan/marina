# Marina

Monorepo for desktop apps that share UI and desktop-shell infrastructure.
Each app ships two ways from the same Svelte renderer: the original
Electron build, and a native Linux build on Tauri with a Rust backend
(see [Native Linux builds](#native-linux-builds-tauri)).

## Apps

- `apps/noteliner/`   — outliner-style note-taking
- `apps/threadliner/` — RSS reader with git sync
- `apps/pageliner/`   — EPUB/PDF e-reader and document library

### NoteLiner

NoteLiner is a single-user outliner-style note-taking application, built with Electron and Svelte 5. It allows users to create and organize files in a hierarchical structure. Each file is written in Markdown with syntax highlighting, and all changes are automatically synced via Git.

NoteLiner should be considered BETA software. I wrote it for my own personal use, and it meets my specific needs.

### ThreadLiner

A desktop RSS reader built with Electron, Svelte, and Git-synced JSON. Supports RSS 2.0, Atom, and JSON Feed formats.

### PageLiner

An e-reader and document library for EPUB and PDF, with bookmarks, highlights, reading-position persistence, and optional Git sync of the library index and reading state.

## Packages

- `packages/desktop-ui/` — shared UI components, theme system, Electron host helpers, and the Tauri IPC shim.

## Rust crates

- `crates/marina-core/` — framework-independent backend shared by all apps: git sync, JSON stores, XDG paths, debouncing.
- `crates/marina-tauri/` — the Tauri host shared by all apps: the Electron-compatible IPC bridge, window chrome, UI prefs, dialogs, update check.
- `crates/noteliner-core/`, `crates/threadliner-core/`, `crates/pageliner-core/` — each app's backend (ported from its `src/main/*.js`), independent of the UI shell so the planned GTK build can reuse it.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (Vite 6 prefers 22.12+; 20.x works with a warning)
- npm 9+

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all workspaces and links them via the root `package-lock.json`.

## Build

```bash
npm run build              # builds both apps (apps/<app>/dist/)
npm run build:noteliner
npm run build:threadliner
```

## Run in development

Both apps share the same dev orchestration (`scripts/dev.js` per app):
start Vite, wait for `Local:` in its output, then spawn Electron with
`NODE_ENV=development` so the main process loads the dev server URL
instead of the built file. Save in your editor → HMR.

```bash
npm run electron:dev -w noteliner       # Vite on 5250 + Electron
npm run electron:dev -w threadliner     # Vite on 5251 + Electron

# Root shortcuts:
npm run electron:noteliner
npm run electron:threadliner
```

The two apps use different Vite ports (5250 / 5251), so you can run them
side-by-side without a collision.

Renderer-only (no Electron window — useful when you just want to iterate
on Svelte components):

```bash
npm run dev -w noteliner       # or: npm run dev:noteliner
npm run dev -w threadliner     # or: npm run dev:threadliner
```

## Run a built app

After `npm run build`:

```bash
npm run start -w noteliner
npm run start -w threadliner
```

## Native Linux builds (Tauri)

Each app has a `src-tauri/` crate that replaces the Electron main process
with Rust. The renderer and even `src/main/preload.js` are shared: at build
time the preload is bundled against `@marina/desktop-ui/tauri-shim`, which
stands in for the `electron` module, so `window.api` is identical in both
builds and every `ipcRenderer.invoke(channel, …)` reaches a Rust handler
with the same channel name.

Settings and data live in the same places as the Electron build
(`~/.config/<App>/…`, the same project/library/data folders, byte-identical
JSON and frontmatter), so you can switch between the two builds freely.

### Additional prerequisites

- Rust 1.85+ (`rustup`)
- Tauri's system libraries:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libssl-dev \
    libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libxdo-dev patchelf
  ```

- `git` at runtime, as with the Electron build.

### Develop

```bash
npm run tauri:noteliner      # Vite on 5250 + the Tauri window, with HMR
npm run tauri:threadliner    # 5251
npm run tauri:pageliner      # 5253
```

### Test

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
```

### Package

```bash
npm run tauri:build -w noteliner    # → target/release/bundle/{deb,rpm,appimage}/
npm run tauri:build -w threadliner
npm run tauri:build -w pageliner
```

Packages are 5–7 MB (vs. 100 MB+ for Electron) and depend on the system WebKitGTK. If the
Electron `.deb` of the same app is installed, remove it first; both
install a `/usr/bin/<app>` launcher.

### NoteLiner's MCP server

In the Tauri build the `noteliner` binary is its own MCP bridge: point MCP
clients at `noteliner --mcp-bridge` (Settings → MCP shows the exact
snippet). No Node.js runtime is required.

## App icons

Each app's icon originates from a master SVG inside the app:

- `apps/noteliner/assets/icon.svg`
- `apps/threadliner/assets/icon.svg`

The pipeline from SVG to packaged app is:

1. `scripts/rasterize-icon.js` (headless Electron) renders each app's
   `assets/icon.svg` to a 512×512 `assets/icon.png` alongside it.
2. Each app's `build:icons` step (ImageMagick, in `apps/<app>/scripts/build-icons.sh`)
   pads that PNG into a square `apps/<app>/build/icon.png`.
3. `electron-builder` reads `build/icon.png` and derives the platform
   icons (`.icns`, `.ico`, multi-size PNG sets) at package time.

The Tauri builds use pre-generated sizes in `apps/<app>/src-tauri/icons/`;
regenerate them after changing `assets/icon.png` with
`npx tauri icon assets/icon.png -o src-tauri/icons` from the app folder
(then delete the `android/`, `ios/`, `Square*`, `StoreLogo` and `@2x`
outputs, which the Linux bundles don't use).

After editing either source SVG, regenerate the per-app PNGs:

```bash
npm run icons:rasterize                 # both apps
npm run icons:rasterize:noteliner       # one app
npm run icons:rasterize:threadliner
```

Commit the updated `apps/<app>/assets/icon.png` alongside the SVG change.
Step 2 runs automatically as part of `build:linux` / `build:win` / `build:mac` / `build:all`.
